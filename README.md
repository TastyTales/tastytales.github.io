Welcome to the Vore Personality Test, currently being managed by @_TastyTales! 

I'm happy to look at any Pull Requests, hoping to keep working on the project myself. Current things I'm planning are:

TO DO LIST:
- Adding an Unwilling Predator Test

- Create an Observer test : Need some more time for research, but this could be feasible?

- Creating 'Master Tests' that combine both for Predators and Prey and add a new Unwilling/Willing stat.

- Dare I say it, making a disgustingly long 160 question "Switch Test"? 

- Refining the Personalities to match a specific format (Right now it's a mix of "You are" and "SEPN is", this should be universal across all results.

- Adding details on how percentages affect outcomes.

- Adding a way to navigate between different types.

- Writing how different types interact.

- Enhancing the Descriptions to talk about how different 'leading categories' might affect your personality (For instance, an IVAN who's I value is the highest would be more selfish, but one who's A value is the highest would be more focused on the thrill of the chase.)

- A warning for matching scores, suggesting the user checks the other type (and then providing a link to it) to see if that's closer to them.

- Add better comments to the functions in the code
